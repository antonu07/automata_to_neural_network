# Faster and Explainable Neural Networks trough Atomata Learning

This tool is based on [Detano](https://github.com/vhavlena/detano/tree/master) tool.
This modification was created to explore combining the explainable structure of
the automaton aproach with the broader analysis offered by neural networks.
